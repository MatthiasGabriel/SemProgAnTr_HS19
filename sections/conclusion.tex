\section{Conclusion}
In this article, the basics of symbolic execution and concolic testing were examined. At the start, the basics of constraint solvers were discussed, to provide some basic knowledge about the reasoning that happens in the background. 
Based on KLEE the concepts of symbolic execution and concolic testing were presented in combination with examples and graphics to allow the reader to better comprehend the concepts.
As the last point, a small comparison between handwritten tests and generated tests is presented to show the limits of generated tests.
