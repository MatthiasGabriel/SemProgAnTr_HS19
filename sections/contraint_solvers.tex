\section{Constraint Solvers}
A constraint solver is basically a program that tries to find a valid solution to a formulated logical problem. 
There are many different types of constraint solvers, that are sometimes generic and sometimes very specific to a problem domain.
In this section you will find an overview over the two types of costraint solvers that are used in KLEE to solve the logical problems, that arrise during concolic execution.
