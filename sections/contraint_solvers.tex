\section{Constraint Solvers}\label{section:contraint_solvers}
A constraint solver is a program that tries to find a valid solution to a formulated logical problem. 
There are many different types of constraint solvers, that are sometimes generic and sometimes very specific to a problem domain.
In this section, you will find an overview of the two types of constraint solvers that are used in KLEE to solve the logical problems, that arise during concolic execution.
