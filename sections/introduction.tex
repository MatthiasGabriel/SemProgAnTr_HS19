\section{Introduction}
Conclic testing is a method to find programming errors by executing it in a special mode.
Instead of using concrete values the program will be executed on so called symbolic values.
This publication summarizes the basic knowledge that is required to understand how concolic testing works and when it's appropriate to use it.

Section \ref{section:contraint_solvers} contains some insights about constraints solvers, which are used heavily in symbolic and concolic execution.
Section \ref{section:symbolic_execution} section presents the basics of symbolic execution.
Section \ref{section:concolic_testing} finally focuses on concolic testing based on the example of KLEE \cite{Cadar:2008:KUA:1855741.1855756}. 
Section \ref{section:handwritten_vs_generated_tests} contains a short breakdown about my opinion where concolic testing is helpful and where it's limits are.
