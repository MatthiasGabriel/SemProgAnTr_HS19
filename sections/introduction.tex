\section{Introduction}

Section \ref{section:contraint_solvers} contains some insights about constraints solvers, which are used heavily in symbolic and concolic execution.
Section \ref{section:symbolic_execution} section presents the basics of symbolic execution.
Section \ref{section:concolic_testing} finally focuses on concolic testing based on the example of KLEE \cite{Cadar:2008:KUA:1855741.1855756}. 
Section \ref{section:handwritten_vs_generated_tests} contains a short breakdown about my opinion where concolic testing is helpful and where it's limits are.
