\subsection{Satisfiability Modulo Theories}
How SMT solvers work in comparison to SAT solvers.
Especially how the STP \cite{Ganesh:2007:DPB:1770351.1770421} (used in KLEE and other tools) works.
Basically by transforming the input and solve the result of the transformation, if neccessary, with a SAT solver.
